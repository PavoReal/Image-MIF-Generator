# Image to .MIF

This is a quick and dirty .MIF generator I wrote for OIT's CST231 course. Building should be
straight forward, provided clang is in your PATH. If not, you should be able to modify build.sh to
suit your needs, build.sh is dead simple. I make no promises about the validity of the output, but it does
work for me. If it's not working for you, ensure that your input image is in an RGB 8 bit format. That
*shouldn't* be needed, but it may actually be.

Feel free to do whatever with the source, as long as you make some note about where it came from
(here). I will update this repo if I ever make changes to the generator, but no promises.
